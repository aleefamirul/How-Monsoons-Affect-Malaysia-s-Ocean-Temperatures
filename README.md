## 🔍 Key Insights  
1. **Temperature Drops During the Northeast Monsoon**  
   - Lower temperatures observed from **November to March** due to increased cloud cover and rainfall.  
2. **Warming Effect of the Southwest Monsoon**  
   - Higher temperatures recorded from **May to September**, coinciding with reduced rainfall.  
3. **El Niño Years Amplify Temperature Increases**  
   - **2015-2016 El Niño event** led to a **+1.5°C anomaly** during the dry monsoon season.  
4. **Regional Variability**  
   - Coastal areas experience smaller temperature fluctuations compared to inland regions.  

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements  
- Incorporate **wind speed and humidity** data for deeper climate insights.  
- Use **machine learning models** to predict temperature trends during future monsoons.  
- Extend the analysis to **energy demand patterns**, linking monsoon effects to cooling/heating needs.
